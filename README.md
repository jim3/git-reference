### Git Reference Sheet

The completion of [Boot.dev's Learn Git](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-git) course is what prompted this repository. 
The course is a great resource for getting started with  the [Git command-line interface (CLI)](https://git-scm.com/) and GitHub. This will be less of a "cheatsheet" and more of explanation of commands in detail, as well as a reference for some of the more commonly used commands.
